Analyzing the relationship between smoking and health indicators using logistic regression.
# Smoking and Health Analysis 🚬📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between smoking and various health indicators using logistic regression in R. The dataset includes demographic and health-related variables to determine factors influencing smoking habits. The findings provide insights into public health trends and the impact of smoking on individuals' well-being.

## 📁 Repository Contents
- **`Smoking-Health_Analysis.R`** - R script for data analysis and modeling.
- **`cleaned_train_dataset.csv`** - cleaned dataset for project analysis and test modeling.
- **`Smoking-Health_Analysis.pptx`** - Presentation slides summarizing key findings and insights.

## 🔍 Key Features
- **Data Processing & Cleaning**: Handling missing values and preparing data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization and summary statistics of key variables.
- **Logistic Regression Modeling**: Predicting smoking habits based on health and demographic factors.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance and interpretation of coefficients.
- **Insights & Recommendations**: Public health implications based on statistical findings.

## 🛠️ How to Run the Code
1. Install the required R packages:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "car", "caret"))
2. Open Smoking-Health_Analysis.R in RStudio.
3. Set the working directory and load the dataset.
4. Run the script step-by-step to generate analysis and visualizations.

##  📊 Results & Insights
Age, income level, and health conditions significantly influence smoking behavior.
